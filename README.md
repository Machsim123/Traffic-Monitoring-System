# 🚦 Traffic Tunnel Monitoring System

**An intelligent Arduino-powered system for tunnel safety and traffic control.**

## 🔥 Why This Project?

Managing traffic inside tunnels is crucial for safety. This system autonomously **monitors vehicles, detects hazards (gas leaks, fires), and controls access barriers** to prevent accidents and congestion. With emergency overrides and real-time alerts, this is an **essential tool for tunnel management.**

---
## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Smart Vehicle Counting** – Uses IR sensors to track cars entering and exiting.
✅ **Hazard Detection** – Monitors for gas leaks and fires.
✅ **Automatic Tunnel Lockdown** – Closes barriers if an emergency is detected.
✅ **Manual Override** – Emergency button and operator control.
✅ **Visual & Audio Alerts** – LEDs and a buzzer notify of emergencies.
✅ **Adaptive Lighting System** – Adjusts based on ambient light.
