# 🚦 **Traffic Monitoring System**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project is an **Arduino-based system** designed to **monitor and manage traffic in tunnels**, integrating **real-time vehicle counting, hazard detection, and emergency handling**. Developed by a **team of three**, the system ensures safety through **automated barrier control and alert mechanisms**.

The system includes:
- **Real-time vehicle monitoring** using IR sensors.
- **Hazard detection** for gas leaks and fires.
- **Emergency response system** with manual overrides and automatic lockdown.

## 📂 **Features & Functionality**
✅ **Traffic Flow Management:** Uses **IR sensors** to detect and count vehicles entering/exiting the tunnel.  
✅ **Hazard Detection & Emergency Handling:** Monitors for **gas leaks, fires**, and **manual emergency triggers**.  
✅ **Automated Barrier Control:** Regulates access using **servo motors** based on real-time sensor data.  
✅ **Visual & Audio Alerts:** Implements **LED indicators and buzzer alarms** for critical warnings.  
✅ **Manual Operator Control:** Enables external overrides for safety interventions.
